let's analyze the comparison of bootstrap samples with the population for the variable "BloodPressure." We'll focus on the mean, standard deviation, and 95th percentile.

Mean BloodPressure:

Bootstrap Samples: The mean BloodPressure values for the 500 bootstrap samples were calculated, and their average mean was obtained.
Population: The mean BloodPressure for the entire population was calculated.
Observation:
The mean BloodPressure in the bootstrap samples is comparable to the population mean, suggesting that the bootstrap samples are representative.
Standard Deviation BloodPressure:

Bootstrap Samples: The standard deviation of BloodPressure values for each of the 500 bootstrap samples was calculated, and their average standard deviation was obtained.
Population: The standard deviation of BloodPressure for the entire population was calculated.
Observation:
The average standard deviation of BloodPressure in the bootstrap samples is close to the population standard deviation, indicating that the variability in the samples aligns with the population.

95th Percentile BloodPressure:

Bootstrap Samples: The 95th percentile of BloodPressure values for each of the 500 bootstrap samples was calculated, and their average 95th percentile was obtained.
Population: The 95th percentile of BloodPressure for the entire population was calculated.
Observation:
The average 95th percentile of BloodPressure in the bootstrap samples is similar to the population's 95th percentile, indicating that the bootstrap samples capture the upper range of BloodPressure values in a manner consistent with the population.

Overall Conclusion:
The bootstrap samples provide estimates (mean, standard deviation, and 95th percentile) that are in line with the corresponding population statistics for BloodPressure.
The bootstrap method seems to effectively capture the variability and distribution of BloodPressure in the population.
